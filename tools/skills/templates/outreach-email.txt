Hi {{name}},

Saw {{company}}{{#website}} ({{website}}){{/website}} and had a quick idea to grow pipeline without adding headcount.

In short: we run a targeted outbound + offer revamp that reliably books qualified calls. We focus on quality (conversion) over volume and iterate copy/styles that actually convert. {{notes}}

If it’s useful, I can share a 2-step plan we’ve used to lift replies by 10–30% and book meetings within a week.

Worth a 10-minute chat this week?
