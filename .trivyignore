# Trivy ignore file
# Add noisy or irrelevant vulnerability IDs here to suppress them from scans.
# Each line can be a vulnerability ID (e.g., CVE-2023-12345) or a wildcard.
# Keep this list tight and justify each entry in commit messages.

# Examples (commented):
# CVE-2020-12345   # dev-only transitive dependency, not shipped
# GHSA-xxxx-xxxx   # false positive in example code under docs/
